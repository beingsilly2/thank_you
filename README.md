What is hope, what is fear?
Hope is the force that pushes you to live your life, hope is why we lived to pass 2020, hope is power, hope is light, and it is time to hope, to save lives is to hope to save lives but to save a life that's a force that drives the kindness that powers their hope.
Fear is the force that keeps us alive, and we have fear to keep us away from danger.
Fear is why we have homes, why we have cities and most importantly, friends and family.
Love you forever RIP Mum.

Thank you.
